# Minimax for Tic-Tac-Toe game
A __PHP__ implementation of Minimax algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe game

## Main goals

The main goal is provide a __PHP__ implementation for Minimax recursive algorithm.
In this implementation the Minimax algorithm is applied to Tic-tac-toe game.

The __PHP__ class provided has three methods:

- minimax _- Implement Minimax algorithm_
- findBestMove _- Use Minimax algorithm to find the best move_
- checkCurrentState _- Check the state of the match_
